                    Hi! I'm Mr Meeseeks! Look at me! Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. It's fine,
                    everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities Morty, and in a few dozens of those i
                    got
                    lucky and turned everything back to normal. Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad.<br>
                    <br>
                    You can run, but you can't hide bitch! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a quick solo adventure to
                    go on
                    and this one will not be directed by Ron Howard. Well let me check my list of powers and weaknesses:
                    ability to do anything, but only whenever I want. Yeah, that sounds like a job for me. I'm your
                    worst
                    nightmare, bitch!<br>
                    <br>
                    There is no god, in your face! One dot muthafucka! Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. Dont
                    mind
                    those stare goblins. Hit the sack, Jack!<br>
                    <br>
                    Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle
                    down
                    and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you
                    kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a
                    little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person! I'm sorry, Morty. It's
                    a
                    bummer. In reality you're as dumb as they come. Your blood will be my lotion! Jesus Christ! Did the
                    boomy-booms blow up all your wordy-word books?
