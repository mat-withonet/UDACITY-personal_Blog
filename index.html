                <p><q cite="http://loremricksum.com/">Do you wanna develop an app? My appearance is designed to be
                        familiar and to put you at ease. Aw, why
                        can't couples that start out cheating ever end up happy? Your failures are your own, old man! I
                        say,
                        follow throooough!</q> <br>
                    <br>
                    Rick, is this a Saw thing? Are you seriously Sawing the Vindicators? Pluto's a planet. Nothing you
                    do
                    matters, your existence is a lie! Ooohhh can do.<br>
                    <br>
                    Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle
                    down
                    and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you
                    kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a
                    little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person! I'll tell you how I
                    feel
                    about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other,
                    got a
                    guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give
                    you a
                    carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not
                    a
                    place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the
                    issue. You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. I
                    know
                    the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that
                    as
                    far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit! Yeah. I can prove it mathematically.
                    Actually,
                    l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming, anyways.
