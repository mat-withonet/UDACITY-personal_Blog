# UDACITY Personal Blog

Personal Blog Website
This project required me to utilize HTML and CSS skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

This is part of the Udacity Front End Developer Nano degree.
